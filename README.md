# str2num
This program convert a string into a numeric representation.
For now, the command convert every character into its position in the alphabet :

```bash
$ str2num "cat"
3120
$ str2num "dog"
4157
```

## To-Do
The program is just a quick prototype there is a lot to do:

- update the "alphabet" algorithm to handle numbers
- update the "alphabet" algorithm to handle number's base (8, 10, 16, ...)
- add new function working on unicode character
